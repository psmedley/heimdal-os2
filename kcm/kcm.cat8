[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     [1mkcm [22mis a process based credential cache.  To use it, set the KRB5CCNAME
     environment variable to `KCM:[4muid[24m' or add the stanza


     [libdefaults]
             default_cc_name = KCM:%{uid}

     to the [4m/etc/krb5.conf[24m configuration file and make sure [1mkcm [22mis started in
     the system startup files.

     The [1mkcm [22mdaemon can hold the credentials for all users in the system.  Ac-
     cess control is done with Unix-like permissions.  The daemon checks the
     access on all operations based on the uid and gid of the user.  The tick-
     ets are renewed as long as is permitted by the KDC's policy.

     The [1mkcm [22mdaemon can also keep a SYSTEM credential that server processes
     can use to access services.  One example of usage might be an nss_ldap
     module that quickly needs to get credentials and doesn't want to renew
     the ticket itself.
