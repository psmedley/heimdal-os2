[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     [1mkdc [22mserves requests for tickets.  When it starts, it first checks the
     flags passed, any options that are not specified with a command line flag
     are taken from a config file, or from a default compiled-in value.

     Options supported:

     [1m-c [4m[22mfile[24m, [1m--config-file=[4m[22mfile[0m
             Specifies the location of the config file, the default is
             [4m/var/heimdal/kdc.conf[24m.  This is the only value that can't be
             specified in the config file.

     [1m-p[22m, [1m--no-require-preauth[0m
             Turn off the requirement for pre-autentication in the initial AS-
             REQ for all principals.  The use of pre-authentication makes it
             more difficult to do offline password attacks.  You might want to
             turn it off if you have clients that don't support pre-authenti-
             cation.  Since the version 4 protocol doesn't support any pre-au-
             thentication, serving version 4 clients is just about the same as
             not requiring pre-athentication.  The default is to require pre-
             authentication.  Adding the require-preauth per principal is a
             more flexible way of handling this.

     [1m--max-request=[4m[22msize[0m
             Gives an upper limit on the size of the requests that the kdc is
             willing to handle.

     [1m-H[22m, [1m--enable-http[0m
             Makes the kdc listen on port 80 and handle requests encapsulated
             in HTTP.

     [1m-r [4m[22mstring[24m, [1m--v4-realm=[4m[22mstring[0m
             What realm this server should act as when dealing with version 4
             requests.  The database can contain any number of realms, but
             since the version 4 protocol doesn't contain a realm for the
             server, it must be explicitly specified.  The default is whatever
             is returned by [1mkrb_get_lrealm[22m().  This option is only available
             if the KDC has been compiled with version 4 support.

     [1m-P [4m[22mportspec[24m, [1m--ports=[4m[22mportspec[0m
             Specifies the set of ports the KDC should listen on.  It is given
             as a white-space separated list of services or port numbers.

     [1m--addresses=[4m[22mlist[24m [4mof[24m [4maddresses[0m
             The list of addresses to listen for requests on.  By default, the
             kdc will listen on all the locally configured addresses.  If only
             a subset is desired, or the automatic detection fails, this op-
             tion might be used.

     [1m--detach[0m
             detach from pty and run as a daemon.

     [1m--disable-des[0m
             disable all des encryption types, makes the kdc not use them.

     All activities are logged to one or more destinations, see krb5.conf(5),
     and krb5_openlog(3).  The entity used for logging is [1mkdc[22m.

[1mCONFIGURATION FILE[0m
     The configuration file has the same syntax as krb5.conf(5), but will be
     read before [4m/etc/krb5.conf[24m, so it may override settings found there.  Op-
     tions specific to the KDC only are found in the "[kdc]" section.  All the
     command-line options can preferably be added in the configuration file.
     The only difference is the pre-authentication flag, which has to be spec-
     ified as:

           require-preauth = no

     (in fact you can specify the option as [1m--require-preauth=no[22m).

     And there are some configuration options which do not have command-line
     equivalents:

           enable-digest = [4mboolean[0m
                turn on support for digest processing in the KDC.  The default
                is FALSE.

           check-ticket-addresses = [4mboolean[0m
                Check the addresses in the ticket when processing TGS re-
                quests.  The default is TRUE.

           allow-null-ticket-addresses = [4mboolean[0m
                Permit tickets with no addresses.  This option is only rele-
                vant when check-ticket-addresses is TRUE.

           allow-anonymous = [4mboolean[0m
                Permit anonymous tickets with no addresses.

           historical_anon_realm = [4mboolean[0m
                Enables pre-7.0 non-RFC-comformant KDC behavior.  With this
                option set to true the client realm in anonymous pkinit AS
                replies will be the requested realm, rather than the RFC-con-
                formant WELLKNOWN:ANONYMOUS realm.  This can have a security
                impact on servers that expect to grant access to anonymous-
                but-authenticated to the KDC users of the realm in question:
                they would also grant access to unauthenticated anonymous
                users.  As such, it is not recommend to set this option to
                true.

           max-kdc-datagram-reply-length = [4mnumber[0m
                Maximum packet size the UDP rely that the KDC will transmit,
                instead the KDC sends back a reply telling the client to use
                TCP instead.

           transited-policy = always-check | allow-per-principal |
                always-honour-request
                This controls how KDC requests with the
                disable-transited-check flag are handled. It can be one of:

                      always-check
                           Always check transited encoding, this is the de-
                           fault.

                      allow-per-principal
                           Currently this is identical to always-check.  In a
                           future release, it will be possible to mark a prin-
                           cipal as able to handle unchecked requests.

                      always-honour-request
                           Always do what the client asked.  In a future re-
                           lease, it will be possible to force a check per
                           principal.

           encode_as_rep_as_tgs_rep = [4mboolean[0m
                Encode AS-Rep as TGS-Rep to be bug-compatible with old DCE
                code.  The Heimdal clients allow both.

           kdc_warn_pwexpire = [4mtime[0m
                How long before password/principal expiration the KDC should
                start sending out warning messages.

     The configuration file is only read when the [1mkdc [22mis started.  If changes
     made to the configuration file are to take effect, the [1mkdc [22mneeds to be
     restarted.

     An example of a config file:

           [kdc]
                   require-preauth = no
                   v4-realm = FOO.SE

[1mBUGS[0m
     If the machine running the KDC has new addresses added to it, the KDC
     will have to be restarted to listen to them.  The reason it doesn't just
     listen to wildcarded (like INADDR_ANY) addresses, is that the replies has
     to come from the same address they were sent to, and most OS:es doesn't
     pass this information to the application.  If your normal mode of opera-
     tion require that you add and remove addresses, the best option is proba-
     bly to listen to a wildcarded TCP socket, and make sure your clients use
     TCP to connect.  For instance, this will listen to IPv4 TCP port 88 only:

           kdc --addresses=0.0.0.0 --ports="88/tcp"

     There should be a way to specify protocol, port, and address triplets,
     not just addresses and protocol, port tuples.
