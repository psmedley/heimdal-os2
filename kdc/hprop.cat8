[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     [1mhprop [22mtakes a principal database in a specified format and converts it
     into a stream of Heimdal database records. This stream can either be
     written to standard out, or (more commonly) be propagated to a hpropd(8)
     server running on a different machine.

     If propagating, it connects to all [4mhosts[24m specified on the command by
     opening a TCP connection to port 754 (service hprop) and sends the data-
     base in encrypted form.

     Supported options:

     [1m-m [4m[22mfile[24m, [1m--master-key=[4m[22mfile[0m
             Where to find the master key to encrypt or decrypt keys with.

     [1m-d [4m[22mfile[24m, [1m--database=[4m[22mfile[0m
             The database to be propagated.

     [1m--source=[4m[22mheimdal|mit-dump|krb4-dump|kaserver[0m
             Specifies the type of the source database. Alternatives include:

                   heimdal   a Heimdal database
                   mit-dump  a MIT Kerberos 5 dump file
             +.It Fl k Ar keytab , Fl Fl keytab= Ns Ar keytab The keytab to
             use for fetching the key to be used for authenticating to the
             propagation daemon(s). The key [4mhprop/hostname[24m is used from this
             keytab.  The default is to fetch the key from the KDC database.

     [1m-R [4m[22mstring[24m, [1m--v5-realm=[4m[22mstring[0m
             Local realm override.

     [1m-D[22m, [1m--decrypt[0m
             The encryption keys in the database can either be in clear, or
             encrypted with a master key. This option transmits the database
             with unencrypted keys.

     [1m-E[22m, [1m--encrypt[0m
             This option transmits the database with encrypted keys. This is
             the default if no option is supplied.

     [1m-n[22m, [1m--stdout[0m
             Dump the database on stdout, in a format that can be fed to
             hpropd.

[1mEXAMPLES[0m
     The following will propagate a database to another machine (which should
     run hpropd(8)):

           $ hprop slave-1 slave-2
