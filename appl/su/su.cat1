[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     [1msu [22mwill use Kerberos authentication provided that an instance for the
     user wanting to change effective UID is present in a file named [4m.k5login[0m
     in the target user id's home directory

     A special case exists where `root's' [4m~/.k5login[24m needs to contain an entry
     for: `user/<instance>@REALM' for [1msu [22mto succed (where <instance> is `root'
     unless changed with [1m-i[22m).

     In the absence of either an entry for current user in said file or other
     problems like missing `host/hostname@REALM' keys in the system's keytab,
     or user typing the wrong password, [1msu [22mwill fall back to traditional
     [4m/etc/passwd[24m authentication.

     When using [4m/etc/passwd[24m authentication, [1msu [22mallows `root' access only to
     members of the group `wheel', or to any user (with knowledge of the
     `root' password) if that group does not exist, or has no members.

     The options are as follows:

     [1m-K[22m, [1m--no-kerberos [22mdon't use Kerberos.

     [1m-f [22mdon't read .cshrc.

     [1m-l[22m, [1m--full [22msimulate full login.

     [1m-m [22mleave environment unmodified.

     [1m-i [4m[22minstance[24m, [1m--instance=[4m[22minstance[24m root instance to use.

     [1m-c [4m[22mcommand[24m, [1m--command=[4m[22mcommand[24m command to execute.
