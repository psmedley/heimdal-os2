     The bbsseeaarrcchh program performs binary searches of _f_i_l_e which must be a
     sorted flat text file.

     Each line is a record.  Each record starts with a key that is optionally
     followed by whitespace and a value.  Whitespace may be quoted with a
     backslash, but newline and carriage-return characters must be quoted in
     some other manner (e.g., as backslash-n and backslash-r).  Escapes are
     not interpreted nor removed.

     If no key arguments are given on the comman-line, then keys will be read
     from standard input.

     By default only values are printed to standard output.  Use the -K option
     to also print keys.  The exit status will be non-zero if any key lookups
     fail.

     Options are:

     --KK      Print keys.

     --VV      Don't print values.

     --hh      Print usage and exit.

     --vv      Print statistic and debug information to standard error.  _f_i_l_e A
             sorted flat text file.  NOTE: use the "C" locale for sorting this
             file, as in "LC_ALL=C sort -u -o file file".

     --hh      For getting a help message.

     --mm      Set _m_a_x_-_c_a_c_h_e_-_s_i_z_e as the maximum cache size.  If the _f_i_l_e is
             smaller than this size then the whole file will be read into mem-
             ory, else the program will read blocks.  Defaults to 1MB.

     --bb      Set _b_l_o_c_k_-_s_i_z_e as the block size for block-wise I/O.  This must
             be a power of 2, must be no smaller than 512 and no larger than
             1MB.  Defaults to the _f_i_l_e_'_s filesystem's preferred blocksize.

     Records must not be longer than one block's size.

     Flat text files must be sorted in the "C" locale.  In some systems the
     default locale may result in case-insensitive sorting by the sort com-
     mand.
