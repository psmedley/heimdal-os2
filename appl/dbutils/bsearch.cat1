[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     The [1mbsearch [22mprogram performs binary searches of [4mfile[24m which must be a
     sorted flat text file.

     Each line is a record.  Each record starts with a key that is optionally
     followed by whitespace and a value.  Whitespace may be quoted with a
     backslash, but newline and carriage-return characters must be quoted in
     some other manner (e.g., as backslash-n and backslash-r).  Escapes are
     not interpreted nor removed.

     If no key arguments are given on the comman-line, then keys will be read
     from standard input.

     By default only values are printed to standard output.  Use the -K option
     to also print keys.  The exit status will be non-zero if any key lookups
     fail.

     Options are:

     [1m-K      [22mPrint keys.

     [1m-V      [22mDon't print values.

     [1m-h      [22mPrint usage and exit.

     [1m-v      [22mPrint statistic and debug information to standard error.  [4mfile[24m A
             sorted flat text file.  NOTE: use the "C" locale for sorting this
             file, as in "LC_ALL=C sort -u -o file file".

     [1m-h      [22mFor getting a help message.

     [1m-m      [22mSet [4mmax-cache-size[24m as the maximum cache size.  If the [4mfile[24m is
             smaller than this size then the whole file will be read into mem-
             ory, else the program will read blocks.  Defaults to 1MB.

     [1m-b      [22mSet [4mblock-size[24m as the block size for block-wise I/O.  This must
             be a power of 2, must be no smaller than 512 and no larger than
             1MB.  Defaults to the [4mfile's[24m filesystem's preferred blocksize.

[1mNOTES[0m
     Records must not be longer than one block's size.

     Flat text files must be sorted in the "C" locale.  In some systems the
     default locale may result in case-insensitive sorting by the sort com-
     mand.
