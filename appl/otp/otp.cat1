[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     The [1motp [22mprogram initializes and updates your current series of one-time
     passwords (OTPs).

     Use this to set a new series of one-time passwords.  Only perform this on
     the console or over an encrypted link as you will have to supply your
     pass-phrase.  The other two parameters are [4msequence-number[24m and [4mseed[24m.

     Options are:

     [1m-d      [22mTo delete a one-time password.

     [1m-f      [22mChoose a different [4malgorithm[24m from the default md5.  Pick any of:
             md4, md5, and sha.

     [1m-h      [22mFor getting a help message.

     [1m-l      [22mList the current table of one-time passwords.

     [1m-o      [22mTo open (unlock) the otp-entry for a user.

     [1m-r      [22mTo renew a one-time password series.  This operation can be per-
             formed over an potentially eavesdropped link because you do not
             supply the pass-phrase.  First you need to supply the current
             one-time password and then the new one corresponding to the sup-
             plied [4msequence-number[24m and [4mseed[24m.

     [1m-u      [22mTo choose a different [4muser[24m to set one-time passwords for.  This
             only works when running [1motp [22mas root.
