[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     The [1motpprint [22mprogram prints lists of OTPs.

     Use this to print out a series of one-time passwords.  You will have to
     supply the [4msequence[24m [4mnumber[24m and the [4mseed[24m as arguments and then the program
     will prompt you for your pass-phrase.

     There are several different print formats.  The default is to print each
     password with six short english words.

     Options are:

     [1m-e      [22mPrint the passwords in ``extended'' format.  In this format a
             prefix that says ``hex:'' or ``word:'' is included.

     [1m-f      [22mTo choose a different [4malgorithm[24m from the default md5.  Pick any
             of: md4, md5, and sha.

     [1m-h      [22mPrint the passwords in hex.

     [1m-n      [22mPrint [4mcount[24m one-time passwords, starting at [4msequence-number[24m and
             going backwards. The default is 10.
