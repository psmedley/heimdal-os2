[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     [1mafslog [22mobtains AFS tokens for a number of cells. What cells to get tokens
     for can either be specified as an explicit list, as file paths to get to-
     kens for, or be left unspecified, in which case [1mafslog [22mwill use whatever
     magic krb_afslog(3) decides upon.

     Supported options:

     [1m--no-v5[0m
             This makes [1mafslog [22mnot try using Kerberos 5.

     [1m-P [4m[22mprincipal[24m, [1m--principal [4m[22mprincipal[0m
             select what Kerberos 5 principal to use.

     [1m--cache [4m[22mcache[0m
             select what Kerberos 5 credential cache to use.  [1m--principal[0m
             overrides this option.

     [1m-u[22m, [1m--unlog[0m
             Destroy tokens instead of obtaining new. If this is specified,
             all other options are ignored (except for [1m--help [22mand [1m--version[22m).

     [1m-v[22m, [1m--verbose[0m
             Adds more verbosity for what is actually going on.

     [1m-c [4m[22mcell,[24m [1m--cell=[4m[22mcell[0m
             This specified one or more cell names to get tokens for.

     [1m-k [4m[22mrealm[24m, [1m--realm=[4m[22mrealm[0m
             This is the Kerberos realm the AFS servers live in, this should
             normally not be specified.

     [1m-p [4m[22mpath[24m, [1m--file=[4m[22mpath[0m
             This specified one or more file paths for which tokens should be
             obtained.

     Instead of using [1m-c [22mand [1m-p[22m, you may also pass a list of cells and file
     paths after any other options. These arguments are considered files if
     they are either the strings "."  or ".." or they contain a slash, or if
     there exists a file by that name.

[1mEXAMPLES[0m
     Assuming that there is no file called "openafs.org" in the current direc-
     tory, and that [4m/afs/openafs.org[24m points to that cell, the follwing should
     be identical:

           $ afslog -c openafs.org
           $ afslog openafs.org
           $ afslog /afs/openafs.org/some/file
