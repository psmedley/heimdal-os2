     [1mpagsh [22mcreates a new credential cache sandbox for the user to live in.  If
     AFS is installed on the computer, the user is put in a newly created
     Process Authentication Group (PAG).

     For Kerberos 5, the credential cache type that is used is the same as the
     credential cache type that was used at the time of [1mpagsh [22minvocation.  The
     credential cache type can be controlled by the option [1m--cache-type[22m.

[1mEXAMPLES[0m
     Create a new sandbox where new credentials can be used, while the old
     credentials can be used by other processes.
