[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     [1mipropd-master [22mis used to propagate changes to a Heimdal Kerberos database
     from the master Kerberos server on which it runs to slave Kerberos
     servers running [1mipropd-slave[22m.

     The slaves are specified by the contents of the [4mslaves[24m file in the KDC's
     database directory, e.g. [4m/var/heimdal/slaves[24m.  This has principals one
     per-line of the form
           iprop/[4mslave[24m@[4mREALM[0m
     where [4mslave[24m is the hostname of the slave server in the given [4mREALM[24m, e.g.
           iprop/kerberos-1.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM
     On a slave, the argument [4mmaster[24m specifies the hostname of the master
     server from which to receive updates.

     In contrast to hprop(8), which sends the whole database to the slaves
     regularly, [1miprop [22mnormally sends only the changes as they happen on the
     master.  The master keeps track of all the changes by assigning a version
     number to every transaction to the database.  The slaves know which was
     the latest version they saw, and in this way it can be determined if they
     are in sync or not.  A log of all the transactions is kept on the master.
     When a slave is at an older version than the oldest one in the log, the
     whole database has to be sent.

     The log of transactions is also used to implement a two-phase commit
     (with roll-forward for recovery) method of updating the HDB.  Transac-
     tions are first recorded in the log, then in the HDB, then the log is up-
     dated to mark the transaction as committed.

     The changes are propagated over a secure channel (on port 2121 by de-
     fault).  This should normally be defined as "iprop/tcp" in [4m/etc/services[0m
     or another source of the services database.  The master and slaves must
     each have access to a keytab with keys for the [1miprop [22mservice principal on
     the local host.

     There is a keep-alive feature logged in the master's [4mslave-stats[24m file
     (e.g. [4m/var/heimdal/slave-stats[24m).
