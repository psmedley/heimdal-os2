[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     These functions implement the old API to get a list of Kerberos hosts,
     and are thus similar to the [1mkrb5_krbhst_init[22m() functions. However, since
     these functions returns [4mall[24m hosts in one go, they potentially have to do
     more lookups than necessary. These functions remain for compatibility
     reasons.

     After a call to one of these functions, [4mhostlist[24m is a NULL terminated
     list of strings, pointing to the requested Kerberos hosts. These should
     be freed with [1mkrb5_free_krbhst[22m() when done with.

[1mEXAMPLES[0m
     The following code will print the KDCs of the realm "MY.REALM".

           char **hosts, **p;
           krb5_get_krbhst(context, "MY.REALM", &hosts);
           for(p = hosts; *p; p++)
               printf("%s\n", *p);
           krb5_free_krbhst(context, hosts);
