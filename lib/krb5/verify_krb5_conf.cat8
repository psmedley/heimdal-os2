     [1mverify_krb5_conf [22m-- checks krb5.conf for obvious errors

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
     [1mverify_krb5_conf [4m[22m[config-file][0m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     [1mverify_krb5_conf [22mreads the configuration file [4mkrb5.conf[24m, or the file
     given on the command line, parses it, checking verifying that the syntax
     is not correctly wrong.

     If the file is syntactically correct, [1mverify_krb5_conf [22mtries to verify
     that the contents of the file is of relevant nature.

[1mENVIRONMENT[0m
     KRB5_CONFIG points to the configuration file to read.

[1mFILES[0m
     /etc/krb5.conf  Kerberos 5 configuration file

[1mDIAGNOSTICS[0m
     Possible output from [1mverify_krb5_conf [22minclude:

     <path>: failed to parse <something> as size/time/number/boolean
             Usually means that <something> is misspelled, or that it contains
             weird characters. The parsing done by [1mverify_krb5_conf [22mis more
             strict than the one performed by libkrb5, so strings that work in
             real life might be reported as bad.

     <path>: host not found (<hostname>)
             Means that <path> is supposed to point to a host, but it can't be
             recognised as one.

     <path>: unknown or wrong type
             Means that <path> is either a string when it should be a list,
             vice versa, or just that [1mverify_krb5_conf [22mis confused.

     <path>: unknown entry
             Means that <string> is not known by [1mverify_krb5_conf[22m.

[1mSEE ALSO[0m
     krb5.conf(5)

[1mBUGS[0m
     Since each application can put almost anything in the config file, it's
     hard to come up with a watertight verification process. Most of the de-
     fault settings are sanity checked, but this does not mean that every
     problem is discovered, or that everything that is reported as a possible
     problem actually is one. This tool should thus be used with some care.

     It should warn about obsolete data, or bad practice, but currently
     doesn't.
