[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     [1mkrb5_parse_name[22m() converts a string representation of a principal name to
     [1mkrb5_principal[22m.  The [4mprincipal[24m will point to allocated data that should
     be freed with [1mkrb5_free_principal[22m().

     The string should consist of one or more name components separated with
     slashes ("/"), optionally followed with an "@" and a realm name. A slash
     or @ may be contained in a name component by quoting it with a backslash
     ("\").  A realm should not contain slashes or colons.
