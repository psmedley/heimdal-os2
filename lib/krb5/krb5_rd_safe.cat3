[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     [1mkrb5_rd_safe[22m() and [1mkrb5_rd_priv[22m() parses KRB-SAFE and KRB-PRIV messages
     (as generated by krb5_mk_safe(3) and krb5_mk_priv(3)) from [4minbuf[24m and ver-
     ifies its integrity. The user data part of the message in put in [4moutbuf[24m.
     The encryption state, including keyblocks and addresses, is taken from
     [4mauth_context[24m.  If the KRB5_AUTH_CONTEXT_RET_SEQUENCE or
     KRB5_AUTH_CONTEXT_RET_TIME flags are set in the [4mauth_context[24m the sequence
     number and time are returned in the [4moutdata[24m parameter.
