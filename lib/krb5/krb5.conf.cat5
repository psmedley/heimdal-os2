     [1mkrb5.conf [22m-- configuration file for Kerberos 5

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
     [1m#include <krb5.h>[0m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     The [1mkrb5.conf [22mfile specifies several configuration parameters for the
     Kerberos 5 library, as well as for some programs.

     The file consists of one or more sections, containing a number of bind-
     ings.  The value of each binding can be either a string or a list of
     other bindings.  The grammar looks like:

           file:
                   /* empty */
                   sections

           sections:
                   section sections
                   section

           section:
                   '[' section_name ']' bindings

           section_name:
                   STRING

           bindings:
                   binding bindings
                   binding

           binding:
                   name '=' STRING
                   name '=' '{' bindings '}'

           name:
                   STRING

     STRINGs consists of one or more non-whitespace characters.

     STRINGs that are specified later in this man-page uses the following no-
     tation.

           boolean
                values can be either yes/true or no/false.

           time
                values can be a list of year, month, day, hour, min, second.
                Example: 1 month 2 days 30 min.  If no unit is given, seconds
                is assumed.

           etypes
                valid encryption types are: des-cbc-crc, des-cbc-md4, des-cbc-
                md5, des3-cbc-sha1, arcfour-hmac-md5, aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96,
                and aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96 .

           address
                an address can be either a IPv4 or a IPv6 address.

     Currently recognised sections and bindings are:

           [appdefaults]
                Specifies the default values to be used for Kerberos applica-
                tions.  You can specify defaults per application, realm, or a
                combination of these.  The preference order is:

                           from the default realm.  If a principal argument is
                           specified, it is used as an explicit realm name for
                           anonymous pkinit even without an @ prefix.

                           files then krb5_userok(3) will not fallback on
                           principal to username mapping. This option is pro-
                           vided for compatibility with MIT krb5 configuration
                           files.

                      kuserok = [4mrule[24m [4m...[0m
                           Specifies krb5_userok(3) behavior.  If multiple
                           values are given, then krb5_userok(3) will evaluate
                           them in order until one succeeds or all fail.
                           Rules are implemented by plugins, with three built-
                           in plugins described below. Default: USER-K5LOGIN
                           SIMPLE DENY.

                      kuserok = [4mDENY[0m
                           If set and evaluated then krb5_userok(3) will deny
                           access to the given username no matter what the
                           principal name might be.

                      kuserok = [4mSIMPLE[0m
                           If set and evaluated then krb5_userok(3) will use
                           principal to username mapping (see auth_to_local
                           below).  If the principal maps to the requested
                           username then access is allowed.

                      kuserok = [4mSYSTEM-K5LOGIN[:directory][0m
                           If set and evaluated then krb5_userok(3) will use
                           k5login files named after the [4mluser[24m argument to
                           krb5_userok(3) in the given directory or in
                           [4m/etc/k5login.d/[24m.  K5login files are text files,
                           with each line containing just a principal name;
                           principals apearing in a user's k5login file are
                           permitted access to the user's account. Note: this
                           rule performs no ownership nor permissions checks
                           on k5login files; proper ownership and permis-

                           rules.  Each rule consists of one or more tokens
                           separated by colon (':').  Currently these rules

                           credentials from a keytab).  These rules can be
                           used to implement DNS resolver-like search lists
                           without having to use DNS.

                           NOTE: Name canonicalization rules are an experimen-
                           tal feature.

                           Any remaining tokens must be options tokens:

                           When trying to obtain a service ticket for a host-
                           based service principal name, name canonicalization
                           rules are applied to that name in the order given,
                           one by one, until one succeds (a service ticket is
                           obtained), or all fail.  Similarly when acquiring
                           GSS initiator credentials from a keytab, and when
                           comparing a non-canonical GSS name to a canonical
                           one.

                           For each rule the system checks that the hostname
                           has at least [4mmindots[24m periods (if given) in it, at
                           most [4mmaxdots[24m periods (if given), that the hostname
                           ends in the given [4mmatch_domain[24m (if given), and that
                           the realm of the principal matches the [4mmatch_realm[0m
                           (if given).

                           [4mAs-is[24m rules leave the hostname unmodified but may
                           set a realm.  [4mQualify[24m rules qualify the hostname
                           with the given [4mdomain[24m and also may set the realm.
                           The [4mnss[24m rule uses the system resolver to lookup the
                           host's canonical name and is usually not secure.
                           Note that using the [4mnss[24m rule type implies having to
                           have principal aliases in the HDB (though not nec-
                           essarily in keytabs).

                           The empty realm denotes "ask the client's realm's
                           TGS".  The empty realm may be set as well as
                           matched.

                           The order in which rules are applied is as follows:
                           first all the rules with explicit [4morder[24m then all
                           other rules in the order in which they appear.  If
                           any two rules have the same explicit [4morder[24m, their
                           order of appearance in krb5.conf breaks the tie.
                           Explicitly specifying order can be useful where
                           tools read and write the configuration file without
                           preserving parameter order.

                           Malformed rules are ignored.

                      allow_hierarchical_capaths = [4mboolean[0m
                           When validating cross-realm transit paths, absent
                           any explicit capath from the client realm to the
                           server realm, allow a hierarchical transit path via
                           the common ancestor domain of the two realms.  De-
                           faults to true.  Note, absent an explicit setting,
                           hierarchical capaths are always used by the KDC
                           when generating a referral to a destination with
                           which is no direct trust.

           [domain_realm]
                This is a list of mappings from DNS domain to Kerberos realm.
                Each binding in this section looks like:

                      domain = realm

                The domain can be either a full name of a host or a trailing
                component, in the latter case the domain-string should start
                with a period.  The trailing component only matches hosts that
                are in the same domain, ie ".example.com" matches
                "foo.example.com", but not "foo.test.example.com".

                The realm may be the token `dns_locate', in which case the ac-
                tual realm will be determined using DNS (independently of the
                setting of the `dns_lookup_realm' option).

                                      Possible services are "udp", "tcp", and
                                      "http".  Http can also be written as
                                      "http://".  Default service is "udp" and
                                      "tcp".

[1mDIAGNOSTICS[0m
     Since [1mkrb5.conf [22mis read and parsed by the krb5 library, there is not a
     lot of opportunities for programs to report parsing errors in any useful
     format.  To help overcome this problem, there is a program
     [1mverify_krb5_conf [22mthat reads [1mkrb5.conf [22mand tries to emit useful diagnos-
     tics from parsing errors.  Note that this program does not have any way
     of knowing what options are actually used and thus cannot warn about un-
     known or misspelled ones.
