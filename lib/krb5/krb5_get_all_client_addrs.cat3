[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     These functions return in [4maddrs[24m a list of addresses associated with the
     local host.

     The server variant returns all configured interface addresses (if possi-
     ble), including loop-back addresses. This is useful if you want to create
     sockets to listen to.

     The client version will also scan local interfaces (can be turned off by
     setting libdefaults/scan_interfaces to false in [4mkrb5.conf[24m), but will not
     include loop-back addresses, unless there are no other addresses found.
     It will remove all addresses included in libdefaults/ignore_addresses but
     will unconditionally include addresses in libdefaults/extra_addresses.

     The returned addresses should be freed by calling [1mkrb5_free_addresses[22m().
