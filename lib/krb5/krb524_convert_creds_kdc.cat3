[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     Convert the Kerberos 5 credential to Kerberos 4 credential.  This is done
     by sending them to the 524 service in the KDC.

     [1mkrb524_convert_creds_kdc[22m() converts the Kerberos 5 credential in [4min_cred[0m
     to Kerberos 4 credential that is stored in [4mcredentials[24m.

     [1mkrb524_convert_creds_kdc_ccache[22m() is different from
     [1mkrb524_convert_creds_kdc[22m() in that way that if [4min_cred[24m doesn't contain a
     DES session key, then a new one is fetched from the KDC and stored in the
     cred cache [4mccache[24m, and then the KDC is queried to convert the credential.

     This interfaces are used to make the migration to Kerberos 5 from Ker-
     beros 4 easier.  There are few services that still need Kerberos 4, and
     this is mainly for compatibility for those services.  Some services, like
     AFS, really have Kerberos 5 supports, but still uses the 524 interface to
     make the migration easier.
