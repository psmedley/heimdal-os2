     [1mkrb5_aname_to_localname[22m([4mkrb5_context[24m [4mcontext[24m, [4mkrb5_const_principal[24m [4mname[24m,

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This function takes a principal [4mname[24m, verifies that it is in the local
     realm (using [1mkrb5_get_default_realms[22m()) and then returns the local name
     of the principal.

     If [4mname[24m isn't in one of the local realms an error is returned.

     If the size ([4mlnsize[24m) of the local name ([4mlname[24m) is too small, an error is
     returned.

     [1mkrb5_aname_to_localname[22m() should only be use by an application that im-
     plements protocols that don't transport the login name and thus needs to
     convert a principal to a local name.

     Protocols should be designed so that they authenticate using Kerberos,
     send over the login name and then verify the principal that is authenti-
     cated is allowed to login and the login name.  A way to check if a user
     is allowed to login is using the function [1mkrb5_kuserok[22m().
