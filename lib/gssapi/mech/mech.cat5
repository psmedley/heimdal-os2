[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     The [4m/etc/gss/mech[24m file contains a list of installed GSS-API security
     mechanisms.  Each line of the file either contains a comment if the first
     character is '#' or it contains five fields with the following meanings:

     Name    The name of this GSS-API mechanism.

     Object identifier
             The OID for this mechanism.

     Library
             A shared library containing the implementation of this mechanism.

     Kernel module (optional)
             A kernel module containing the implementation of this mechanism
             (not yet supported in FreeBSD).

     Library options (optional)
             Optionsal parameters interpreted by the mechanism. Library op-
             tions must be enclosed in brackets ([ ]) to differentiate them
             from the optional kernel module entry.

     The [4m/etc/gss/qop[24m file contains a list of Quality of Protection values for
     use with GSS-API.  Each line of the file either contains a comment if the
     first character is '#' or it contains three fields with the following
     meanings:

     QOP string
             The name of this Quality of Protection algorithm.

     QOP value
             The numeric value used to select this algorithm for use with GSS-
             API functions such as gss_get_mic(3).

     Mechanism name
             The GSS-API mechanism name that corresponds to this algorithm.
