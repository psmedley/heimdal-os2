[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     Generic Security Service API (GSS-API) version 2, and its C binding, is
     described in RFC2743 and RFC2744.  Version 1 (deprecated) of the C bind-
     ing is described in RFC1509.

     Heimdals GSS-API implementation supports the following mechanisms

     [1m+o   [22mGSS_KRB5_MECHANISM

     [1m+o   [22mGSS_SPNEGO_MECHANISM

     GSS-API have generic name types that all mechanism are supposed to imple-
     ment (if possible):

     [1m+o   [22mGSS_C_NT_USER_NAME

     [1m+o   [22mGSS_C_NT_MACHINE_UID_NAME

     [1m+o   [22mGSS_C_NT_ANONYMOUS

     [1m+o   [22mGSS_C_NT_EXPORT_NAME

     GSS-API implementations that supports Kerberos 5 have some additional
     name types:

     [1m+o   [22mGSS_KRB5_NT_PRINCIPAL_NAME

     [1m+o   [22mGSS_KRB5_NT_USER_NAME

     [1m+o   [22mGSS_KRB5_NT_STRING_UID_NAME

     In GSS-API, names have two forms, internal names and contiguous string
     names.

     [1m+o   [22mInternal name and mechanism name

         Internal names are implementation specific representation of a GSS-
         API name.  Mechanism names special form of internal names corresponds
         to one and only one mechanism.

         In GSS-API an internal name is stored in a gss_name_t.

     [1m+o   [22mContiguous string name and exported name

         Contiguous string names are gssapi names stored in a OCTET STRING
         that together with a name type identifier (OID) uniquely specifies a
         gss-name.  A special form of the contiguous string name is the ex-
         ported name that have a OID embedded in the string to make it unique.
         Exported name have the nametype GSS_C_NT_EXPORT_NAME.

         In GSS-API an contiguous string name is stored in a gss_buffer_t.

         Exported names also have the property that they are specified by the
         mechanism itself and compatible between different GSS-API implementa-
         tions.

[1mACCESS CONTROL[0m
     There are two ways of comparing GSS-API names, either comparing two in-
     ternal names with each other or two contiguous string names with either
     other.

     To compare two internal names with each other, import (if needed) the
     names with [1mgss_import_name[22m() into the GSS-API implementation and the com-
     pare the imported name with [1mgss_compare_name[22m().

     Importing names can be slow, so when its possible to store exported names
     in the access control list, comparing contiguous string name might be
     better.

     when comparing contiguous string name, first export them into a
     GSS_C_NT_EXPORT_NAME name with [1mgss_export_name[22m() and then compare with
     memcmp(3).

     Note that there are might be a difference between the two methods of com-
     paring names.  The first (using [1mgss_compare_name[22m()) will compare to
     (unauthenticated) names are the same.  The second will compare if a mech-
     anism will authenticate them as the same principal.

     For example, if [1mgss_import_name[22m() name was used with GSS_C_NO_OID the de-
     fault syntax is used for all mechanism the GSS-API implementation sup-
     ports.  When compare the imported name of GSS_C_NO_OID it may match sev-
     eral mechanism names (MN).

     The resulting name from [1mgss_display_name[22m() must not be used for acccess
     control.

[1mFUNCTIONS[0m
     [1mgss_display_name[22m() takes the gss name in [4minput_name[24m and puts a printable
     form in [4moutput_name_buffer[24m.  [4moutput_name_buffer[24m should be freed when done
     using [1mgss_release_buffer[22m().  [4moutput_name_type[24m can either be NULL or a
     pointer to a gss_OID and will in the latter case contain the OID type of
     the name.  The name must only be used for printing.  If access control is
     needed, see section [4mACCESS[24m [4mCONTROL[24m.

     [1mgss_inquire_context[22m() returns information about the context.  Information
     is available even after the context have expired.  [4mlifetime_rec[24m argument
     is set to GSS_C_INDEFINITE (don't expire) or the number of seconds that
     the context is still valid.  A value of 0 means that the context is ex-
     pired.  [4mmech_type[24m argument should be considered readonly and must not be
     released.  [4msrc_name[24m and [1mdest_name[22m() are both mechanims names and must be
     released with [1mgss_release_name[22m() when no longer used.

     [1mgss_context_time [22mwill return the amount of time (in seconds) of the con-
     text is still valid.  If its expired [4mtime_rec[24m will be set to 0 and
     GSS_S_CONTEXT_EXPIRED returned.

     [1mgss_sign[22m(), [1mgss_verify[22m(), [1mgss_seal[22m(), and [1mgss_unseal[22m() are part of the
     GSS-API V1 interface and are obsolete.  The functions should not be used
     for new applications.  They are provided so that version 1 applications
     can link against the library.

[1mEXTENSIONS[0m
     [1mgss_krb5_ccache_name[22m() sets the internal kerberos 5 credential cache name
     to [4mname[24m.  The old name is returned in [4mold_name[24m, and must not be freed.
     The data allocated for [4mold_name[24m is free upon next call to
     [1mgss_krb5_ccache_name[22m().  This function is not threadsafe if [4mold_name[24m ar-
     gument is used.

     [1mgss_krb5_copy_ccache[22m() will extract the krb5 credentials that are trans-
     ferred from the initiator to the acceptor when using token delegation in
     the Kerberos mechanism.  The acceptor receives the delegated token in the
     last argument to [1mgss_accept_sec_context[22m().

     [1mgss_krb5_import_cred[22m() will import the krb5 credentials (both keytab
     and/or credential cache) into gss credential so it can be used withing
     GSS-API.  The [4mccache[24m is copied by reference and thus shared, so if the
     credential is destroyed with [4mkrb5_cc_destroy[24m, all users of thep
     [4mgss_cred_id_t[24m returned by [1mgss_krb5_import_ccache[22m() will fail.

     [1mgsskrb5_register_acceptor_identity[22m() sets the Kerberos 5 filebased keytab
     that the acceptor will use.  The [4midentifier[24m is the file name.

     [1mgsskrb5_extract_authz_data_from_sec_context[22m() extracts the Kerberos au-
     thorizationdata that may be stored within the context.  Tha caller must
     free the returned buffer [4mad_data[24m with [1mgss_release_buffer[22m() upon success.

     [1mgss_krb5_get_tkt_flags[22m() return the ticket flags for the kerberos ticket
     receive when authenticating the initiator.  Only valid on the acceptor
     context.

     [1mgss_krb5_compat_des3_mic[22m() turns on or off the compatibility with older
     version of Heimdal using des3 get and verify mic, this is way to program-
     matically set the [gssapi]broken_des3_mic and [gssapi]correct_des3_mic
     flags (see COMPATIBILITY section in gssapi(3)).  If the CPP symbol
     GSS_C_KRB5_COMPAT_DES3_MIC is present, [1mgss_krb5_compat_des3_mic[22m() exists.
     [1mgss_krb5_compat_des3_mic[22m() will be removed in a later version of the GSS-
     API library.
