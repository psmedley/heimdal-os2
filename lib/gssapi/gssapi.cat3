GSSAPI(3)                BSD Library Functions Manual                GSSAPI(3)

[1mNAME[0m
     [1mgssapi [22m-- Generic Security Service Application Program Interface library

[1mLIBRARY[0m
     GSS-API Library (libgssapi, -lgssapi)

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     The Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) pro-
     vides security services to callers in a generic fashion, supportable with
     a range of underlying mechanisms and technologies and hence allowing
     source-level portability of applications to different environments.

     The GSS-API implementation in Heimdal implements the Kerberos 5 and the
     SPNEGO GSS-API security mechanisms.

[1mLIST OF FUNCTIONS[0m
     These functions constitute the gssapi library, [4mlibgssapi[24m.  Declarations
     for these functions may be obtained from the include file [4mgssapi.h[24m.

[1mCOMPATIBILITY[0m
     The [1mHeimdal [22mGSS-API implementation had a bug in releases before 0.6 that
     made it fail to inter-operate when using DES3 with other GSS-API imple-
     mentations when using [1mgss_get_mic[22m() / [1mgss_verify_mic[22m().  It is possible
     to modify the behavior of the generator of the MIC with the [4mkrb5.conf[0m
     configuration file so that old clients/servers will still work.

     New clients/servers will try both the old and new MIC in Heimdal 0.6.  In
     0.7 it will check only if configured - the compatibility code will be re-
     moved in 0.8.

     Heimdal 0.6 still generates by default the broken GSS-API DES3 mic, this
     will change in 0.7 to generate correct des3 mic.

     To turn on compatibility with older clients and servers, change the
     [1m[gssapi] [4m[22mbroken_des3_mic[24m in [4mkrb5.conf[24m that contains a list of globbing
     expressions that will be matched against the server name.  To turn off
     generation of the old (incompatible) mic of the MIC use [1m[gssapi][0m
     [4mcorrect_des3_mic[24m.

     If a match for a entry is in both [1m[gssapi] [4m[22mcorrect_des3_mic[24m and [1m[gssapi][0m
     [4mbroken_des3_mic[24m, the later will override.

     This config option modifies behaviour for both clients and servers.

     Microsoft implemented SPNEGO to Windows2000, however, they managed to get
     it wrong, their implementation didn't fill in the MechListMIC in the re-
     ply token with the right content.  There is a work around for this prob-
     lem, but not all implementation support it.

     Heimdal defaults to correct SPNEGO when the the kerberos implementation
     uses CFX, or when it is configured by the user.  To turn on compatibility
     with peers, use option [1m[gssapi] [4m[22mrequire_mechlist_mic[24m.
