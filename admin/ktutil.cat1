                 Adds a key to the keytab. Options that are not specified will
                 be prompted for. This requires that you know the password or
                 the hex key of the principal to add; if what you really want
                 is to add a new principal to the keytab, you should consider
                 the [4mget[24m command, which talks to the kadmin server.

                 Update one or several keys to new versions.  By default, use
                 the admin server for the realm of a keytab entry.  Otherwise
                 it will use the values specified by the options.

                 If no principals are given, all the ones in the keytab are
                 updated.

                 Copies all the entries from [4mkeytab-src[24m to [4mkeytab-dest[24m.

                 For each [4mprincipal[24m, generate a new key for it (creating it if
                 it doesn't already exist), and put that key in the keytab.

                 If no [4mrealm[24m is specified, the realm to operate on is taken
                 from the first principal.

     list [[1m--keys[22m] [[1m--timestamp[22m]
                 List the keys stored in the keytab.

                 Removes the specified key or keys. Not specifying a [4mkvno[24m re-
                 moves keys with any version number. Not specifying an [4menctype[0m
                 removes keys of any type.

     rename [4mfrom-principal[24m [4mto-principal[0m
                 Renames all entries in the keytab that match the
                 [4mfrom-principal[24m to [4mto-principal[24m.

     purge [[1m--age=[4m[22mage[24m]
                 Removes all old versions of a key for which there is a newer
                 version that is at least [4mage[24m (default one week) old.
