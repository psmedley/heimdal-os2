[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     [1mkadmind [22mlistens for requests for changes to the Kerberos database and
     performs these, subject to permissions.  When starting, if stdin is a
     socket it assumes that it has been started by inetd(8), otherwise it be-
     haves as a daemon, forking processes for each new connection. The [1m--debug[0m
     option causes [1mkadmind [22mto accept exactly one connection, which is useful
     for debugging.

     The kpasswdd(8) daemon is responsible for the Kerberos 5 password chang-
     ing protocol (used by kpasswd(1)).

     This daemon should only be run on the master server, and not on any
     slaves.

     Principals are always allowed to change their own password and list their
     own principal.  Apart from that, doing any operation requires permission
     explicitly added in the ACL file [4m/var/heimdal/kadmind.acl[24m.  The format of
     this file is:

     [4mprincipal[24m [4mrights[24m [[4mprincipal-pattern[24m]

     Where rights is any (comma separated) combination of:
     [1m+o   [22mchange-password or cpw
     [1m+o   [22mlist
     [1m+o   [22mdelete
     [1m+o   [22mmodify
     [1m+o   [22madd
     [1m+o   [22mget
     [1m+o   [22mget-keys
     [1m+o   [22mall (everything except get-keys)

     And the optional [4mprincipal-pattern[24m restricts the rights to operations on
     principals that match the glob-style pattern.

     Supported options:

     [1m-c [4m[22mfile[24m, [1m--config-file=[4m[22mfile[0m
             location of config file

     [1m-k [4m[22mfile[24m, [1m--key-file=[4m[22mfile[0m

             ports to listen to. By default, if run as a daemon, it listens to
             port 749, but you can add any number of ports with this option.
             The port string is a whitespace separated list of port specifica-
             tions, with the special string "+" representing the default port.

     This will cause [1mkadmind [22mto listen to port 4711 in addition to any com-
     piled in defaults:

     This acl file will grant Joe all rights, and allow Mallory to view and
     add host principals, as well as extract host principal keys (e.g., into
     keytabs).
