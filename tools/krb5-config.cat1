[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     [1mkrb5-config [22mtells the application programmer what special flags to use to
     compile and link programs against the libraries installed by Heimdal.

     Options supported:

     [1m--prefix[22m[=[4mdir[24m]
             Print the prefix if no [4mdir[24m is specified, otherwise set prefix to
             [4mdir[24m.

     [1m--exec-prefix[22m[=[4mdir[24m]
             Print the exec-prefix if no [4mdir[24m is specified, otherwise set exec-
             prefix to [4mdir[24m.

     [1m--libs  [22mOutput the set of libraries that should be linked against.  This
             also includes rpath flags with the expectation that the C com-
             piler is used for final link-edits.

     [1m--cflags[0m
             Output the set of flags to give to the C compiler when using the
             Heimdal libraries.

     By default [1mkrb5-config [22mwill output the set of flags and libraries to be
     used by a normal program using the krb5 API.  The user can also supply a
     library to be used, the supported ones are:

     krb5    (the default)

     gssapi  use the krb5 gssapi mechanism

     kadm-client
             use the client-side kadmin libraries

     kadm-server
             use the server-side kadmin libraries
