[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     [1mkpasswdd [22mserves request for password changes. It listens on UDP port 464
     (service kpasswd) and processes requests when they arrive. It changes the
     database directly and should thus only run on the master KDC.

     Supported options:

     [1m--addresses=[4m[22maddress[0m
             For each till the argument is given, add the address to what
             kpasswdd should listen too.

     [1m--check-library=[4m[22mlibrary[0m
             If your system has support for dynamic loading of shared li-
             braries, you can use an external function to check password qual-
             ity. This option specifies which library to load.

     [1m--check-function=[4m[22mfunction[0m
             This is the function to call in the loaded library. The function
             should look like this:

             [4mconst[24m [4mchar[24m [4m*[24m [1mpasswd_check[22m([4mkrb5_context[24m [4mcontext[24m, [4mkrb5_principal[0m
             [4mprincipal[24m, [4mkrb5_data[24m [4m*password[24m)

             [4mcontext[24m is an initialized context; [4mprincipal[24m is the one who tries
             to change passwords, and [4mpassword[24m is the new password. Note that
             the password (in [4mpassword->data[24m) is not zero terminated.

     [1m-k [4m[22mkspec[24m, [1m--keytab=[4m[22mkspec[0m
             Keytab to get authentication key from.

     [1m-r [4m[22mrealm[24m, [1m--realm=[4m[22mrealm[0m
             Default realm.

     [1m-p [4m[22mstring[24m, [1m--port=[4m[22mstring[0m
             Port to listen on (default service kpasswd - 464).

[1mDIAGNOSTICS[0m
     If an error occurs, the error message is returned to the user and/or
     logged to syslog.

[1mBUGS[0m
     The default password quality checks are too basic.
