[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     [1mkgetcred [22mobtains a ticket for the given service principal.  Usually tick-
     ets for services are obtained automatically when needed but sometimes for
     some odd reason you want to obtain a particular ticket or of a special
     type.

     If [1m--hostbased [22mis given then the given service principal name will be
     canonicalized (see below).

     The third form constructs a host-based principal from the given service
     name and hostname.  The service name "host" is used if the given [4mservice[0m
     name in the third usage is the empty string.

     For host-based names, the local host's hostname is used if the given
     [4mhostname[24m is the empty string or if the [4mprincipal[24m has a single component.

     Any additional components will be included, even for host-based service
     principal names, but there are no defaults nor local canonicalization
     rules for additional components.

     Local name canonicalization rules are applied unless the [1m--canonical [22mop-
     tion is given.  Currently local name canonicalization rules are supported
     only for host-based principal names' hostname component.

     The principal's realm name may be canonicalized by following Kerberos re-
     ferrals from the client principal's home realm if the [1m--canonicalize [22mop-
     tion is given or if the local name canonicalization rules are configured
     to use referrals.

     Supported options:

     [1m--canonicalize[0m
             requests that the KDC canonicalize the principal.  Currently this
             only canonicalizes the realm by chasing referrals from the user's
             start realm, but in the future this may also enable the KDC to
             canonicalize the complete principal name.

     [1m--canonical[0m
             turns off local canonicalization of the principal name.

     [1m--name-type=[4m[22mname-type[0m
             the name-type to use when parsing the principal name.

     [1m--hostbased[0m
             is short for [1m--name-type=srv_hst[22m.

     [1m-c [4m[22mcache[24m, [1m--cache=[4m[22mcache[0m
             the credential cache to use.

     [1m--delegation-credential-cache=[4m[22mcache[0m
             the credential cache to use for delegation.

     [1m-e [4m[22menctype[24m, [1m--enctype=[4m[22menctype[0m
             encryption type to use.

     [1m--no-transit-check[0m
             requests that the KDC doesn't do transit checking.

     [1m--no-store[0m
             do not store tickets in the ccache.

     [1m--cached-only[0m
             do not talk the TGS, search only the ccache.

     [1m--anonymous[0m
             obtain an anonymous service ticket.

     [1m--forwardable[0m

     [1m--debug[0m
             enables debug output to stderr.

     [1m--version[0m

     [1m--help[0m

     If the [1m--canonical [22moption is used, then no further canonicalization
     should be done locally by the client (for example, DNS), but if
     [1m--canonicalize [22mis used, then the client will ask that the KDC canonical-
     ize the name.

     If the [1m--canonicalize [22moption is used with [1m--hostbased [22ma host-based name-
     type, and [1m--canonical [22mis not used, then the hostname will be canonical-
     ized according to the name canonicalization rules in [4mkrb5.conf[24m.

     GSS-API initiator applications with host-based services will get the same
     behavior as using the [1m--canonicalize --hostbased [22moptions here.
