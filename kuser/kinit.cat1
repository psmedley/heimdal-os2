[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     [1mkinit [22mis used to authenticate to the Kerberos server as [4mprincipal[24m, or if
     none is given, a system generated default (typically your login name at
     the default realm), and acquire a ticket granting ticket that can later
     be used to obtain tickets for other services.

     Supported options:

     [1m-c [4m[22mcachename[24m [1m--cache=[4m[22mcachename[0m
             The credentials cache to put the acquired ticket in, if other
             than default.

     [1m-f --forwardable[0m
             Obtain a ticket than can be forwarded to another host.

     [1m-F --no-forwardable[0m
             Do not obtain a forwardable ticket.

     [1m-t [4m[22mkeytabname[24m, [1m--keytab=[4m[22mkeytabname[0m
             Don't ask for a password, but instead get the key from the speci-
             fied keytab.

     [1m-l [4m[22mtime[24m, [1m--lifetime=[4m[22mtime[0m
             Specifies the lifetime of the ticket.  The argument can either be
             in seconds, or a more human readable string like `1h'.

     [1m-p[22m, [1m--proxiable[0m
             Request tickets with the proxiable flag set.

     [1m-R[22m, [1m--renew[0m
             Try to renew ticket.  The ticket must have the `renewable' flag
             set, and must not be expired.

     [1m--renewable[0m
             The same as [1m--renewable-life[22m, with an infinite time.

     [1m-r [4m[22mtime[24m, [1m--renewable-life=[4m[22mtime[0m
             The max renewable ticket life.

     [1m-S [4m[22mprincipal[24m, [1m--server=[4m[22mprincipal[0m
             Get a ticket for a service other than krbtgt/LOCAL.REALM.

     [1m-s [4m[22mtime[24m, [1m--start-time=[4m[22mtime[0m
             Obtain a ticket that starts to be valid [4mtime[24m (which can really be
             a generic time specification, like `1h') seconds into the future.

     [1m-k[22m, [1m--use-keytab[0m
             The same as [1m--keytab[22m, but with the default keytab name (normally
             [4mFILE:/etc/krb5.keytab[24m).

     [1m-v[22m, [1m--validate[0m
             Try to validate an invalid ticket.

     [1m-e[22m, [1m--enctypes=[4m[22menctypes[0m
             Request tickets with this particular enctype.

     [1m--password-file=[4m[22mfilename[0m
             read the password from the first line of [4mfilename[24m.  If the
             [4mfilename[24m is [4mSTDIN[24m, the password will be read from the standard
             input.

     [1m--fcache-version=[4m[22mversion-number[0m
             Create a credentials cache of version [4mversion-number[24m.

     [1m-a[22m, [1m--extra-addresses=[4m[22menctypes[0m
             Adds a set of addresses that will, in addition to the systems lo-
             cal addresses, be put in the ticket.  This can be useful if all
             addresses a client can use can't be automatically figured out.
             One such example is if the client is behind a firewall.  Also
             settable via libdefaults/extra_addresses in krb5.conf(5).

     [1m-A[22m, [1m--no-addresses[0m
             Request a ticket with no addresses.

     [1m-n[22m, [1m--anonymous[0m
             Request an anonymous ticket.  With the default (false) setting of
             the [4mhistorical_anon_pkinit[24m configuration parameter, if the prin-
             cipal is specified as @REALM, then anonymous PKINIT will be used
             to acquire an unauthenticated anonymous ticket and both the
             client name and (with fully RFC-comformant KDCs) realm in the re-
             turned ticket will be anonymized.  Otherwise, authentication pro-
             ceeds as normal and the anonymous ticket will have only the
             client name anonymized.  With [4mhistorical_anon_pkinit[24m set to true,
             the principal is interpreted as a realm even without an at-sign
             prefix, and it is not possible to obtain authenticated anonymized
             tickets.

     [1m--enterprise[0m
             Parse principal as a enterprise (KRB5-NT-ENTERPRISE) name. Enter-
             prise names are email like principals that are stored in the name
             part of the principal, and since there are two @ characters the
             parser needs to know that the first is not a realm.  An example
             of an enterprise name is "lha@e.kth.se@KTH.SE", and this option
             is usually used with canonicalize so that the principal returned
             from the KDC will typically be the real principal name.

     [1m--afslog[0m
             Gets AFS tickets, converts them to version 4 format, and stores
             them in the kernel.  Only useful if you have AFS.

     The [4mforwardable[24m, [4mproxiable[24m, [4mticket_life[24m, and [4mrenewable_life[24m options can
     be set to a default value from the appdefaults section in krb5.conf, see
     krb5_appdefault(3).

     If  a [4mcommand[24m is given, [1mkinit [22mwill set up new credentials caches, and AFS
     PAG, and then run the given command.  When it finishes the credentials
     will be removed.

[1mENVIRONMENT[0m
     KRB5CCNAME
             Specifies the default credentials cache.

     KRB5_CONFIG
             The file name of [4mkrb5.conf[24m, the default being [4m/etc/krb5.conf[24m.
